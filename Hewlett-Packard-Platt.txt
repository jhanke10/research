Abstract: Lewis E. Platt was named president and CEO of Hewlett-Packard Co, succeeding John Young, who will take early retirement in Oct 1992.

Full text: PALO ALTO, Calif. -- Hewlett-Packard Co. named Lewis E. Platt president and chief executive officer, succeeding John Young, who will take early retirement in October after 14 years at the helm of the electronics concern.
Mr. Platt, 51 years old, has been executive vice president and head of the company's computer systems organization and was considered a slight favorite to succeed Mr. Young. The other contender, 55-year-old Richard Hackborn, who has run H-P's thriving computer printer business, continues as an executive vice president, and will be able to contribute "more broadly" to overall management than he has, the company said in a statement. Both men were named to H-P's board.
While Mr. Young was known to be considering retiring, the timing of his announcement was somewhat earlier than analysts anticipated. At the same time, he is leaving the company at a point at which it has been performing better than ever, reflecting a major reorganization that Mr. Young engineered two years ago.
In its second quarter ended April 30, for instance, H-P posted a 40% rise in net income to $326 million, or $1.28 a share, on a 12% rise in revenue to $4.18 billion. H-P stock currently trades at more than twice the level of just 18 months ago. Shares were quoted yesterday in late New York Stock Exchange trading at $69.625, down 50 cents.
"I believe the organization really benefits from fresh leadership," Mr. Young said in an interview. "I really believe that Hewlett-Packard is in a better position than any other company in the world. I fully expect that Lew will seize the opportunities."
Mr. Platt, a 26-year company veteran, is expected to bring an aggressive, competitive style to the company, whose direction and focus should remain much the same. Under Mr. Platt's leadership, H-P introduced a barrage of new workstations that were faster and cheaper than rivals. The new products were accompanied by aggressive advertising showing head-on comparisons with competitors, and H-P's market share subsequently rose for the first time in years. Workstations are powerful computers traditionally used for engineering, but increasingly used by businesses. Sales of H-P minicomputers, meanwhile, rose 25% last year under Mr. Platt's guidance.
Mr. Platt is considered more a professional manager and skilled communicator than Mr. Hackborn, who is considered a brilliant strategist, if something of a rebel, among big company executives, with a disdain for corporate politics. One big factor why he was always considered a second choice for Mr. Young's job, for instance, was the fact that he has refused to relocate from his current office in Boise, Idaho, where he has lived for 15 years. Such a move would have been "a very difficult personal thing," he said in an interview.
Meanwhile, "Lew is an excellent communicator, an extremely hard worker," said Mr. Young. "He makes a big effort to be thoroughly grounded in the technologies."
Mr. Platt becomes the second elected president and chief executive in H-P's 53-year history. The company's founders, William Hewlett and David Packard, directly managed the company until 1978. Mr. Packard is currently chairman as well.
Mr. Platt said in an interview that his appointment "is not signaling any sort of dramatic change of direction, and certainly it doesn't signal any change in the culture of the company." However, over the next few months, Mr. Platt said he will be making some management changes affecting some of the company's foreign and administrative divisions, bringing in new managers and changing lines of communications.
H-P also said that Dean Morton, chief operating officer and an executive vice president, will retire in October and that he and Mr. Young would then leave the company's board. Both men are 60.
In addition, the company said William Roelandts, vice president and general manager of the company's networked systems group, would assume Mr. Platt's duties as computer systems organization chief.

Hewlett chief's forecast sends stock gyrating

http://search.proquest.com/docview/398387174?accountid=14553

Abstract: After Hewlett Packard Co CEO Lewis Platt warned bankers and analysts that the company might not be able to sustain the same order growth in the fiscal third quarter ending Jul 31, 1993 as it posted in the second quarter, the computer concern's stock price fell 8.6% in early trading but then slightly recovered, closing down 3.9%.

Full text: PALO ALTO, Calif. -- Hewlett-Packard Co.'s stock plunged 8.6% in early trading yesterday after its chief executive officer gave a cautionary forecast of the computer firm's prospects, but the stock recovered somewhat, closing down 3.9%, after the company reported relatively healthy order growth so far in its current quarter.
Meanwhile, filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission showed that H-P's chief executive, Lewis Platt, sold a big block of his own holdings of H-P's stock in late May and early June when the stock fetched an average $85, just under its record of $87.50 a share.
According to H-P, Mr. Platt told bankers and analysts in Frankfurt yesterday that the company might not be able to sustain the same order growth in the fiscal third quarter ending July 31 as it posted in its second quarter. For that quarter, H-P reported that net income grew 7.4% from a strong year-ago period to $347 million, that revenue grew 21% to a record $5.1 billion and that orders grew 28%.
Reports of Mr. Platt's comments, coming as H-P's stock hovered near its record price, sent the stock tumbling to as low as $79.50 in the morning, down from Tuesday's closing price of $87.
But H-P officials quickly announced that Mr. Platt's remarks represented no change from the company's past pronouncements, including those made at an analysts' meeting on May 25 in New York. Officials also said that H-P's world-wide orders in the first six weeks of its third quarter grew 19% over the same period last year, down from the 26% order growth in the first half of the year but still within management's expectations. Order growth in Europe this quarter has slowed from first-half levels, the company added.
By the end of the day, the stock had recovered, closing at $83.625, down $3.375, in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
According to SEC filings, Mr. Platt sold 10,000 of his H-P shares, or 22% of his current holdings, in late May and early June. Mr. Platt couldn't be reached for comment about the sales, which are the largest ever by Mr. Platt on record for a single year.
The sale leaves Mr. Platt with 35,795 directly-held shares, 61 indirectly-held shares and options that are currently exercisable to acquire 66,406 shares, according to the SEC data.
An H-P spokesman said Mr. Platt's stock sales, which began around May 20, came within the company's trading window for insiders, typically the three weeks following the day after an earnings announcement.

H-P co-founder David Packard retires; Platt takes on added role of chairman

http://search.proquest.com/docview/398463456?accountid=14553

Abstract: David Packard, who co-founded Hewlett-Packard Co in a tiny California garage in 1939, has retired as chairman of the company. Lewis Platt, the president and CEO, will become chairman in addition to his other duties.

Full text: For the first time since Hewlett-Packard Co. started operations 54 years ago in a tiny California garage, neither of the company's founders will play a formal role in its management.
David Packard, 81 years old, retired Friday as chairman of the Palo Alto, Calif., computer company he founded in 1939 with William Hewlett, 80. H-P said it named Lewis Platt, president and chief executive officer, to the additional post of chairman.
While the torch-passing symbolized for some the end of an era at H-P, which is often cited as the company that gave birth to Silicon Valley, it probably won't have any impact on the company's operation. While Mr. Packard has been active as board chairman and played a hand in the company's turnaround almost three years ago, he and Mr. Hewlett have long been absent from day-to-day operations at H-P, where neither of the founders have been CEO since 1978.
"It's a huge symbolic change," said Mr. Platt in a phone interview. While his succession to chairman happened quickly and with little advance notice, Mr. Platt said, it won't change the company's management. "In terms of strategic direction and overall leadership day-to-day -- that's something the CEO has been doing for a long time," he said.
Still, the move is a big vote of confidence in Mr. Platt, 52, who only last October succeeded John Young, H-P's president and CEO for 14 years. "You look around and try to find the best guy and that's exactly what we did," said Mr. Hewlett, a director emeritus of H-P, at a news conference Friday.
Mr. Packard will become a director emeritus of the company, maintaining quarters in Hewlett-Packard offices that are set aside for former executives. Mr. Packard will have no formal connection to the board but said he will continue offering advice to the company.
Still, Mr. Packard's and Mr. Hewlett's influence will continue to be felt indirectly through the four directors on the 16-member board who are family members of H-P's founders. Each founder already had a family member on the board, and Friday two additional relatives joined as directors: Jean-Paul G. Gimon, 56, Mr. Hewlett's son-in-law and a North American representative of France's Credit Lyonnais and Susan P. Orr, 46, Mr. Packard's daughter and president of Technology Resource Assistance Center, a technology-consulting firm. The new directors fill seats left by Mr. Packard and Condoleeza Rice, 38, who resigned Friday.
H-P also announced several future board changes. Robert P. Wayman, 48, H-P's chief financial officer, will become a director Dec. 1, succeeding William E. Terry, 60, who will retire from his posts as director and H-P executive vice president. H-P also said that directors Hicks B. Waldron, 70, and T.A. Wilson, 72, won't stand for re-election after Feb. 22; their successors weren't announced.
