AMR Chairman Sold Almost One-Fifth of His Stake in Firm Early This Month

http://search.proquest.com/docview/398132810?accountid=14553

Abstract: Robert L. Crandall, the chairman of American Airlines parent AMR Corp, has sold 6,250 AMR shares, nearly one-fifth of his holdings in the company. Crandall is left with 26,000 shares.

Full text: NEW YORK -- Robert L. Crandall, chairman of American Airlines parent AMR Corp., sold nearly one-fifth of his holdings of the company's stock early this month.
Mr. Crandall sold 6,250 AMR shares at $65.25 each, or a total of $407,812, filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission show. Those sales left him with 26,000 shares.
A spokeswoman for AMR, based in Fort Worth, Texas, called the sale "a personal decision by Mr. Crandall" and wouldn't comment further.
AMR closed yesterday in New York Stock Exchange composite trading at $62.875, down 50 cents. Analysts recently lowered their second-quarter earnings forecasts for the airline, according to Zacks Investment Research. The second-quarter consensus for AMR fell to $1.90 a share from $2.06 a share about a month ago, Zacks said.
Mr. Crandall "would have made a little bit more money (by selling) last year," said Timothy Pettee, an analyst for Merrill Lynch & Co. AMR stock was selling for about $105 last year after Donald Trump disclosed that he owned some shares, which he later sold.
Nevertheless, Mr. Pettee said AMR is "building a tremendous amount of longterm value and gaining market share at a rather precipitous rate." He said American, which recently acquired Latin American routes from Eastern Airlines and is seeking to expand in the Far East, is growing at nearly twice the rate of the rest of the airline industry by some measures.
SELLING HIGH-TECH: Executives at a number of technology companies have been selling stock in recent weeks.
The companies include Conner Peripherals Inc., Octel Communications Corp., Hewlett-Packard Co., Silicon Valley Group Inc. and Control Data Corp.
Robert G. Herwick, an analyst with Hambricht & Quist, noted that stock options are often a significant part of compensation packages at technology companies and executives would be likely to sell when they can get a good price. "Valuation of technology stocks has improved somewhat over the last year," he said.
In many cases, prices have risen since the executives sold.
The largest sale listed on the accompanying table was by Finis Conner, chairman and chief executive officer of Conner Peripherals, a San Jose, Calif., computer and data processing firm. According to filings with the SEC, Mr. Conner sold 150,000 shares for nearly $3 million in early May. The sale accounted for only 6% of his holdings, however; he still holds more than two million shares.
Mr. Conner couldn't be reached to comment. SEC filings show that he sold the shares at $19.50 to $19.75 each; the stock closed yesterday in over-the-counter trading at $25.25, up 12.5 cents.
At Octel Communications, a Milpitas, Calif., maker of voice processing systems, the chief executive and several vice presidents sold shares for $22.88 to $24.50 apiece. The stock closed yesterday in OTC trading at $24.75, down $1.25.
The president and chief executive, Robert Cohn, sold 61,000 shares for about $1.4 million. He holds about 319,000 shares. None of the Octel executives could be reached, and a company spokesman wouldn't comment.
A spokeswoman at Control Data in Minneapolis said two vice presidents sold for personal reasons. Both sales were just a portion of their holdings. At Hewlett-Packard in Palo Alto, Calif., a spokesman said shares sold by three vice presidents were part of their incentive compensation, adding that the sales were for personal reasons. The three sold less than half of their holdings.
William Egan, a director of Silicon Valley Group, sold his entire holding of 145,375 shares for $1.5 million. Mr. Egan, who is general partner in the Boston venture capital firm of Burr, Egan, Deleage & Co., said the shares were held on behalf of several venture capital funds that were reaching the end of their terms. "The company was doing well, and we thought it was a good time" to sell, Mr. Egan said.
The stock gained 12.5 cents yesterday to close at $13 in OTC trading, compared with the $10 to $11.50 a share that Mr. Egan received when he sold. Silicon Valley is a maker of chip-making equipment.
ANOTHER CHAIRMAN SELLS: John Masefield, chairman of Isomedix Inc., sold 55,000 shares for $653,425 in May and early this month. Filings with the SEC show that the sales leave him with 139,750 shares and 76,510 warrants.
Mr. Masefield couldn't be reached, and another official of the Whippany, N.J., maker of medical equipment wouldn't comment.
The chairman would have done better to wait. Although he sold at $11.75 to $12 a share, well above the 52-week low of $8.13, the stock closed yesterday in OTC trading at $13.25, down 12.5 cents.

American Air Criticizes Its McDonnell Douglas Jet

http://search.proquest.com/docview/398201937?accountid=14553

Abstract: American Airlines CEO Robert L. Crandall said the carrier isn't pleased with its new $100 million MD-11 airliner, but officials wouldn't comment on reports that the carrier might refuse delivery of a second McDonnell Douglas Corp jumbo jet in Feb 1991.

Full text: FORT WORTH, Texas -- American Airlines Chief Executive Officer Robert L. Crandall told employees that the carrier isn't pleased with its new MD-11 airliner, but officials wouldn't comment on reports that the carrier might refuse delivery of a second McDonnell Douglas Corp. jumbo jet next week.
A McDonnell Douglas spokeswoman, while acknowledging that the carrier has expressed some uneasiness about the MD-11 during proving runs and other pre-service tests, said the aerospace company, based in St. Louis, has received no indication that American will delay receipt of the plane. "We still expect to deliver it" Feb. 28, she said.
However, in meetings Tuesday and yesterday with employees at the Dallas/Fort Worth hub, Mr. Crandall said the airline, a unit of AMR Corp., is "very, very, very unhappy" with the $100 million MD-11.
It's no secret that American has been upset with the manufacturer for some time, initially because the MD-11 was completed behind schedule, and then because the three-engine jet burned more fuel than expected during tests. Now, according to speculation around the aviation industry, American's criticisms center on computer problems. The airline refused to comment.
But the McDonnell Douglas spokeswoman suggested that any software difficulties were more a result of pilots not being familiar with the nuances of the MD-11 than with inherent flaws in the equipment. "We're aware of what American's concerns are," she said. "We've sent people to Dallas to work with them. We don't see any show-stoppers there."

Abstract: American Airlines Chairman Robert Crandall is leading an assault of healthy airliners against those under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, complaining that they have an unfair advantage over healthy companies and hurt the industry's efforts to rebound. Crandall has asked the DOT to consider yanking the certification rights of Continental Airlines, Trans World Airlines, American West and Metro Airlines because they are operating under Chapter 11. Delta Airlines agrees.

Icahn Calls American Air's Fare Cuts Anti-Competitive

http://search.proquest.com/docview/398254797?accountid=14553

Abstract: American Airlines is cutting fares in an effort to drive weaker competitors out of business and will then raise prices if it succeeds, according to Trans World Airlines Inc Chairman Carl Icahn. AMR Corp's American Airlines Chairman Robert Crandall called the program good for consumers and the economy.

Full text: WASHINGTON (AP) -- American Airlines is cutting fares to drive weaker competitors out of business and will raise prices if it succeeds, Carl Icahn, chairman of Trans World Airlines Inc. said.
"You believe in the tooth fairy if you believe these fares aren't going to go back up," Mr. Icahn said on ABC's "This Week with David Brinkley."
Chairman of AMR Corp.'s American, Robert Crandall, said on the same program that the company's new fare structure is "good not only for consumers and for the economy, but it's good for all airlines" because it will increase travel.
"If I were so fortunate as to be the only airline in America . . . we wouldn't raise fares for a long time," he said.
American has announced plans to lower fares as much as 50% in some cases. Many other carriers have matched the new price structure. TWA, which is in bankruptcy court proceedings, said last week it will cut many ticket prices 10% to 20%.

Travel: AMR's Airline-Industry Fare Structure Heads for That Big Hangar in the Sky

http://search.proquest.com/docview/398285722?accountid=14553

Abstract: American Airlines' so-called valued pricing, four-tiered fare structure, introduced by parent AMR Corp Chairman Robert L. Crandall, has ended. The company will keep some of the elements of its value pricing but supplement others.

Full text: After a nasty, brutal and short life, American Airlines' so-called value-pricing policy is over.
Robert Crandall, the chairman of parent AMR Corp. who introduced the fourtiered fare structure April 9 and vowed to defend it from subsequent attacks by rival airlines, apparently has backed down.
"I believe in value pricing, but we have abandoned it," Mr. Crandall said recently in an interview with the British Broadcasting Corp. "We're going to file every cockamamie fare anybody else wants to file. If the industry simply will not coalesce around a particular fare structure, then no carrier can. We tried to provide some price leadership, but it didn't work, so we are back into the death by a thousand cuts."
Mr. Crandall's remarks were reported in yesterday's Aviation Daily, a trade publication, and made to the BBC last week. Spokesmen for AMR, based in Fort Worth, Texas, said Mr. Crandall couldn't comment further, citing a recent "gag order" in a predatory-pricing lawsuit against American filed by three other airlines over value pricing. It was unclear when the order was issued.
Mr. Crandall told a group of Wall Street analysts last month that he wouldn't defend his fare structure forever. But he hadn't before said the company would abandon it. "Actually, they're the only ones who held to it," said Tom Parsons, editor of Best Fares, a newsletter. Other carriers had been offering various other fare cuts for months as demand for travel faltered amid the recession.
American hasn't so much forsaken the four-tiered structure as it has in some cases supplemented it. The carrier has added two low-price tiers in certain markets, matching fare cuts in the Northeast instituted by USAir Group Inc. and elsewhere by Trans World Airlines. And it could add more.
More significantly, American appears to be giving up its role as the industry's price-setter. As the industry's largest airline, American had gone to great lengths to defend the "integrity" of its pricing structure. It brought the fare structure down in lockstep to match cuts by USAir and TWA. And in its most dramatic move, when Northwest Airlines introduced a "Grownups Fly Free" promotion in May, American put its cheapest seats on sale at 50% off.
In an industry where competitors nearly always match the lowest fares on offer, virtually every airline went along. Second-quarter results were dismal, and for perhaps the first time, the usually lucrative third quarter will be an industrywide money-loser. Rival carriers Continental Airlines, Northwest and America West sued American, claiming the fare cuts were actually predatory moves designed to force them out of business. American denies that.
"I think this means that American Airlines has realized that with fare actions such as the one Northwest took for adults with children, American may now be willing to match those without trying to maintain the four-tiered structure," said Warren Lieberman, a senior consultant with Arthur D. Little Inc. in San Francisco.
Many elements in value pricing will remain. Full coach fares will still be cheaper than before it was implemented. Non-changeable, nonrefundable tickets don't exist anymore; passengers can, for a $25 fee, turn tickets in and use them on different dates and even for different destinations.
Value pricing was supposed to simplify the nation's airfares, which had skyrocketed over the past 18 months and become ever more complex. Under the fares that went into effect April 13, American slashed its full coach fare by 38% and its first class fares by close to 50%. Its cheapest fare, a 21-day advance purchase (later changed to a 14-day advance) was about half the cost of the full coach, while the seven-day advance purchase fare was slightly more expensive.
For consumers, stepping away from value pricing opens up the possibility of more discount fares in different markets. At the same time, however, it also means at least a partial return to the complexity of the previous pricing system.
If the lower fares remain low, it's possible that full coach fares will start to creep up. It's an open question as to what will happen to the discounting that American eliminated in one swoop with the institution of value pricing. While cutting the top fare by 38%, American also eliminated corporate, military and senior citizens discounts.
"I think what this indicates is that those corporate fares may well come back into being," said Mr. Lieberman. "Most people in the industry expect to see increases in the full coach fare over the next year or so."

American Airlines' Crandall expects '93 to be year of retrenchment, austerity

http://search.proquest.com/docview/398370213?accountid=14553

Abstract: American Airlines' Chairman Robert L. Crandall, in a speech to financial analysts in Naples FL, said 1993 will be another year of retrenchment and austerity for the AMR Corp unit as it tries to stem its massive losses. The company is considering retiring some aircraft and leaving some markets.

Full text: American Airlines' Chairman Robert L. Crandall said 1993 will be another year of retrenchment and austerity for the AMR Corp. unit, as the once highflying airline tries to stem its massive losses.
Mr. Crandall, in a speech to financial analysts in Naples, Fla., said the company is considering returning or retiring older, more expensive aircraft primarily used for domestic routes. American may also pull out of some markets where traffic has been soft, Mr. Crandall said. Reducing the company's fleet or ending service to certain cities would in turn lead to dismissals, although the company declined to estimate how many people might be affected.
Mr. Crandall stopped short of announcing more drastic cost-saving measures that some analysts have advocated. Those measures include shutting down at least two of American's unprofitable hubs in San Jose, Calif., and Raleigh-Durham, N.C. Mr. Crandall has said American is considering those options.
Mr. Crandall's comments were a reminder that despite signs the economy is improving and a recent run-up in airline stocks, many industry executives remain cautious, if not pessimistic, about the near future. In composite trading Friday on the New York Stock Exchange, AMR closed at $65.125 a share, up 75 cents.
"While I'm optimistic enough to think that 1993 will be better than 1992, I am not at all confident that 1993 will be the turnaround year many hope it will be," Mr. Crandall said.
Last year the Fort Worth, Texas, company posted a loss of $935 million and took several steps, including management dismissals and reduced meal service, to pare $300 million out of operating costs. The nation's largest airline also has slashed capital expenditures three consecutive years.
But Mr. Crandall confirmed that those moves won't be enough to reverse the company's fortunes in an industry riddled by overcapacity, sluggish demand and -- in the eyes of passengers -- high prices.
Mr. Crandall indicated that the company was "looking very aggressively" to exercise its option to return 25 out of 34 wide-body jets to Airbus Industrie. The executive also said American is considering accelerating the retirement of its fleet of 59 DC-10s and will not renew any expiring 727 leases, including 16 727-100s that expire at the end of this year.
Airlines can typically realize significant savings in maintenance costs not only by reducing the size of their fleet but also by reducing the different types of aircraft. For American, the possible cutbacks, all affecting its domestic routes, also underscore that the airline sees its growth in international markets.
In addition, Mr. Crandall said American will be pulling out of unprofitable markets or substituting smaller American Eagle turboprop planes for jets. American has already made such a move at its San Jose hub. The airline recently withdrew 10 daily jet flights and substituted seven commuter flights -- and cut capacity 12%.
Mr. Crandall, however, also said American will be adding service to its strongest destinations -- Dallas-Fort Worth, Miami and San Juan -- and it will be growing in Chicago, where American has a large investment but is struggling in its battle with UAL Corp.'s United Airlines.

Northwest Air's chief testifies he felt pricing pressure from AMR chairman

http://search.proquest.com/docview/398371253?accountid=14553

Abstract: John Dasburg, CEO of Northwest Airlines, testified at an antitrust case filed by Northwest and Continental Airlines against American Airlines that he felt AMR Corp Chairman Robert L. Crandall improperly tried to pressure him to raise air fares.

Full text: GALVESTON, Texas -- The chief executive of Northwest Airlines testified that he felt AMR Corp. Chairman Robert L. Crandall improperly tried to pressure him to raise airline ticket prices.
John Dasburg said Mr. Crandall cautioned him in September 1991 "to make sure I was supervising pricing" at Northwest. "To me, that was a way of saying `you ought to get your prices up,'" the Northwest executive testified.
Mr. Dasburg was testifying at an antitrust case brought by Northwest and Continental Airlines against American Airlines, an AMR unit, in which the two smaller carriers accuse American of cutting fares in the spring of 1992 with an aim toward forcing them out of business.
Aside from its allegedly improper content, the conversation is of interest because it recalls a 1982 exchange between Mr. Crandall and Howard Puttnam, chief executive of now-defunct Braniff Airlines. In that conversation, Mr. Crandall exhorted Mr. Puttnam to raise Braniff's fares 20%, after which American would raise its fares the same amount. (The AMR chairman ultimately settled federal price-fixing charges resulting from that conversation without admitting or denying guilt.) Northwest and Continental weren't permitted to introduce that conversation into evidence at this trial because federal Judge Samuel B. Kent deemed it too old and not germane to the issues involved in this case.
Northwest, a unit of Wings Holdings Inc., is trying to show that Mr. Crandall and American tried to raise fares by various methods, eventually grew frustrated, then introduced 40% fare cuts in April 1992 in an attempt to kill or maim its airline rivals. American contends its "value pricing" initiative was merely an attempt to simplify an overly complicated fare structure and jump-start business travel. The case, which began Monday, is expected to last about five weeks.
Northwest's Mr. Dasburg said the conversation took place after a dinner gathering of airline and aerospace executives, most of them members of an exclusive group called Conquistadores del Cielo, Spanish for "Conquerors of the Sky."
After the dinner, Mr. Dasburg said Mr. Crandall and Donald V. Carty, an AMR executive vice president, took him aside for a private conversation. "They came to me and ushered me to a corner table," Mr. Dasburg said. "They lectured me with regard to pricing at Northwest Airlines."
First, though, Mr. Dasburg said Mr. Crandall warned him that, "there are two of us and one of you, and we'll deny we ever held this meeting." After that, Mr. Crandall "stated that we were a discount carrier, and I personally ought to make sure I was supervising pricing," Mr. Dasburg said, which he said he took to mean that Northwest should raise its rates.
Such a suggestion, if true, could be a violation of federal antitrust law. Mr. Dasburg said he was concerned enough about the conversation that he reported it to Northwest's general counsel within days. He said he didn't change the way he supervised Northwest's pricing practices.
Mr. Dasburg said he was lectured by Mr. Crandall on another occasion, when the AMR chairman expressed anger that Northwest was hiring away a lot of American employees, especially those involved in pricing. He said he couldn't remember when that other conversation took place.
A spokesman for American Airlines said there was never an exchange between Messrs. Crandall and Dasburg about pricing. "The jury will have a chance to hear Mr. Crandall testify about the conversation, which had nothing to do with pricing and everything to do with employee raiding and Northwest's attempt at theft of American's trade secrets," he said. American sued Northwest in Minnesota two years ago, claiming that Northwest tried to steal employees. The suit is pending.
Northwest is attempting to use against Mr. Crandall his reputation and proclivity for speaking strongly and plainly.
On cross-examination, American's attorney, David Beck, asked Mr. Dasburg about a series of Northwest memorandums, presentations and letters he had received or sent out in which he or other Northwest executives apparently endorsed American's pricing plan. In most cases, Mr. Dasburg said he couldn't recall saying so, or that such a comment was taken out of context.
Later Mr. Beck said in an interview, "There's a difference between the story they're trying to tell, and the actual, hard evidence from their own documents."
Earlier in the day, Northwest's cochairman, Gary Wilson, testified that his reaction to hearing that American had cut fares in 1992 was "total shock." The pricing structure American proposed "was totally illogical. . . . You're not going to get more business travelers if you reduce the price."
Mr. Wilson testified that the fare cuts, and a subsequent half-off fare cut last May, helped push Northwest to a pretax loss last year of more than $700 million, far higher than the $200 million or so loss originally forecast by Northwest in 1992. That loss, he said, nearly pushed Northwest into filing for Chapter 11 protection from creditors last December until a lastminute bank loan prevented that action. It did lead to salary cuts for employees and service cutbacks and, eventually, this lawsuit against American. "It's time the bully in the schoolyard got punched," Mr. Wilson said.

Abstract: In testimony in federal court in Galveston TX, American Airlines Chairman Robert L. Crandall denied using fare cuts in 1992 to force rival carriers out of business. Crandall also asserted that his company's "value pricing" system introduced in Apr 1992 would have been profitable. Northwest Airlines and Continental Airlines contend that American's pricing plan would have deliberately incurred huge losses for the carrier while at the same time driving its rivals out of business.

Carty named American Air president, becoming likely successor to Crandall

http://search.proquest.com/docview/398495335?accountid=14553

Abstract: Robert L. Crandall, chairman of AMR Corp, ceded one of the six titles he holds to Donald J. Carty, making Carty the likely candidate to succeed Crandall eventually. Carty was named president of both American Airlines and AMR's newly formed Airline Group.

Full text: Robert L. Crandall loosened his grip on the reins of AMR Corp., but the 59-year-old chairman is still very much in command.
Yesterday, Mr. Crandall ceded one of the six titles he holds to Donald J. Carty, making the 48-year-old Canadian-born executive the likely candidate to succeed him eventually. Mr. Carty was named president of both American Airlines and AMR's newly formed Airline Group. That group includes the airline, four commuter carriers that use the Eagle name, and the company's cargo division.
Most recently, Mr. Carty had been AMR's executive vice president and chief financial officer.
His steely boss, Mr. Crandall, will remain chairman and chief executive officer of both AMR and American and president of AMR. Mr. Crandall says he has no plans to step down for several years. "I'm still in the chain of command," said Mr. Crandall. As for succession, "I think its fair to say that the board of directors will be watching Mr. Carty's performance carefully, and if he succeeds, as I fully expect he will, I'm sure they'll consider him" for the top spot.
The move was one of several AMR announced yesterday in an overhaul of its headquarters it said will cut $93 million a year in costs and eliminate as many as 900 positions.
AMR also announced that Michael J. Durham, 44, will become president of another newly formed unit, the Sabre group. That subsidiary, which includes all of AMR's technology and distribution businesses, has proven more consistently profitable in recent years than its corporate sibling, the airline.
Mr. Durham's promotion apparently edged out Kathleen M. Misunas who had been president and chief executive of the Sabre group as it was structured before now. Ms. Misunas, who started as an American flight attendant 23 years ago, resigned. Mr. Crandall called her departure "one of the great disappointments" of yesterday's changes.
Mr. Carty's accession to the top spot at American had been the subject of speculation for months, especially after rumors last year that he'd been courted for the top job at UAL Corp., the parent of United Airlines.
The tall, prematurely white-haired executive, as unflappable as Mr. Crandall is excitable, is seen as someone who can provide much-needed balm for American's troubled labor relations. The airline is in the uncomfortable position of being in negotiations with two unions and in arbitration with a third. It is seeking savings of $750 million through pay cuts or productivity increases.
Relations between the unions and the strong-willed Mr. Crandall have faltered, and a string of strong profits recently both at the airline and its parent haven't helped the company in its bid to obtain givebacks by labor.
In a telephone conference call yesterday, Mr. Carty said that "solving the labor problems is an imperative." Mr. Crandall, who led the conference call, shrugged off a suggestion that he might have been a lightning rod for union dissatisfaction. "If the unions would like to have somebody else with whom to talk, and I don't know why because I'm a very pleasant fellow, but if they would they now have somebody to do that with," Mr. Crandall said.
A spokesman for the airline's powerful pilots union said it was far too soon to say what influence Mr. Carty will have. "Obviously, a great deal of attention is being paid here to the airline, and we hope that continues," he said.
In putting Mr. Carty at the head of American, the airline also simplifies its organizational structure. Where seven senior executives once reported to four different bosses, now they all answer to Mr. Carty. They include Robert W. Baker, 50, who as executive vice president of operations at AMR and American had been Mr. Carty's counterpart and considered his rival.
Such moves are part of a wide-ranging move to evaluate and streamline corporate functions at the headquarters, in what is called an "activity value analysis" undertaken under the aegis of the Boston Consulting Group, hired last year. The $93 million in cost cuts could grow as the new management structure works its way down the corporate ladder.
This year, those savings will work out to about $38 million, but the company expects to realize the full $93 million in savings in 1996. Of that, $43 million will come from personnel or personnel-related cuts; $20 million from spending less on various management-information systems and communication projects; and about $30 million in miscellaneous cuts. That last category, Mr. Crandall said, would come chiefly from simplifying some tasks and eliminating others.
Gerard Arpey, 37 years old, currently AMR's senior vice president of planning, will take on the added role of senior vice president of finance and planning and succeed Mr. Carty as AMR's chief financial officer.

American Air sees 'good' profit for 3rd period, 'satisfactory' for '96

http://search.proquest.com/docview/398638449?accountid=14553

Abstract: AMR Corp Chairman and CEO Robert L. Crandall said that American Airlines will post "good numbers" for the 1995 third quarter and should enjoy "satisfactory" earnings through 1996, despite a squeeze on profits caused by investments in AMR's airline reservation system. While essentially upbeat, Crandall said American will be essentially treading water in terms of growth until it can find more ways to reduce costs.

Full text: NEW YORK -- AMR Corp.'s American Airlines will post "good numbers" for the third quarter and should enjoy "satisfactory" earnings through next year, despite a squeeze on profits caused by investments in AMR's airline reservation system this fall, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Robert L. Crandall said.
While generally upbeat, Mr. Crandall said American will be essentially treading water in terms of growth until it can find more ways to reduce costs. American has cut routes, postponed retiring older planes, shed expensive wide-body jets and reduced meal service, all while trying to wring savings from its union.
"Until we have gotten all of our costs, including labor, to fully competitive levels, the longerterm outlook for the airline remains less than clear," he told a meeting of analysts here yesterday.
On the labor front, Mr. Crandall said American is willing to tinker with a new six-year contract offered to its 14,000 fleetservice workers, who have voted against ratification. But he said he won't offer anything "substantively better" than the terms agreed to by union negotiators.
AMR shares closed at $70.375, up $2.25, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday. Analysts voiced concerns about Mr. Crandall's prediction that performance of AMR's Sabre Group, its airline reservations unit, "won't be as robust" in the second half of the year as in the first, and a comment that fourth-quarter bookings are running behind 1994.
Mr. Crandall said traffic will be up by 2% to 3% in 1995, and the Fort Worth, Texas-based airline will save $100 million this year because of a $50 cap on travelagent commissions early this year. Earnings in the third quarter, expected to be "good" and within the range of analysts estimates, will include $12.5 million in revenue losses from hurricanes, Mr. Crandall said. Analysts' consensus estimates are $2.91 a share for the third quarter. AMR reported earnings of $2.47 a share in the year-ago third quarter.
"Though it is too early to say for sure, the initial reading is that 1996 should also be satisfactory," Mr. Crandall said.
The ratification vote at the Transport Workers Union, Mr. Crandall said, appears "disappointing," though the company hasn't been officially informed of vote totals. Indications are that fleet-service workers, who include baggage handlers and other ramp workers, have voted down the contract, while the seven other groups of the TWU, including mechanics, each has approved its separate agreement.
American hopes for substantial savings through the contracts, which provide the union with job security and an early retirement option in exchange for putting off wage-scale increases until August 1998 and creation of lower-paying job classes.
The union has been meeting to ratify results. People close to the situation say across the eight contracts, the total vote of all 27,000 TWU members at American appears narrowly against ratification. Thus the union may face the option of asking for new negotiations on all eight contracts, not just the fleet-service pact. Mr. Crandall said the company was willing, but not anxious, to talk over the entire TWU package.
"If most of it's been ratified, we think it certainly a whole lot simpler to go ahead and implement those parts and if we need to rejigger one part, rejigger that part of it," Mr. Crandall said.

American rules out a bid for USAir unless UAL's United makes first move

http://search.proquest.com/docview/398594260?accountid=14553

Abstract: AMR Corp's American Airlines will not make a bid for USAir Group Inc unless United Airlines makes the first move, AMR Chairman and CEO Robert Crandall said in a message to employees.

Full text: AMR Corp.'s American Airlines won't make a bid for USAir Group Inc. unless United Airlines makes the first move, AMR Chairman and Chief Executive Robert Crandall said in a message to employees.
Mr. Crandall said American still considers internal growth to be preferable to consolidation. But if UAL Corp., United's parent, bids for USAir, American may respond, he said.
UAL's board will take up the issue of a bid at a meeting Monday. Mr. Crandall's message was first disclosed in the Washington Post yesterday morning.
"We will not be the first to make a bid for USAir," Mr. Crandall said in the internal message. "On the other hand, if United seeks to acquire USAir, we will be prepared to respond with a bid, or by other means as necessary, to protect American's competitive position."
Last month, USAir disclosed that it was in talks with both United and American that could lead to an acquisition of USAir by one of its larger rivals. Troubled USAir failed to win wage concessions from its workers and last summer put itself up for sale.
United, which is 55%-owned by its employees, has said it won't proceed with a bid unless the acquisition meets certain criteria, including gaining employee support. Gerald Greenwald, UAL's chairman and chief executive, also has said USAir employees would have to agree in advance to cost-saving concessions.
United and its investment banker, Merrill Lynch & Co., have nearly completed a study of a United-USAir combination, and that study will be presented to UAL directors on Monday, according to individuals familiar with the planning. If the study indicates the accord wouldn't meet UAL's financial criteria, directors are expected to drop the idea.
But if those requirements would appear to be satisfied, according to people familiar with the situation, directors could approve a bid contingent on UAL shareholder approval, or they could make a bid contingent on obtaining United worker assent and USAir worker givebacks in advance. Two of UAL's 12 directors are union representatives and they have special voting power in cases of acquisitions and other big transactions.
A USAir acquisition by United could trigger a rapid industry consolidation, analysts say. One possible response for American would be to raise antitrust concerns, and perhaps persuade the federal government to force the sale of valuable USAir assets like landing slots at key East Coast airports.

AMR CEO gets a $150,000 raise in base salary

http://search.proquest.com/docview/398605082?accountid=14553

Abstract: A banner year financially for American Airlines' parent AMR Corp led to the first salary raise in six years for Chairman and CEO Robert Crandall, according to the firm's proxy statement. Crandall's base pay was boosted to $750,000 a year from $600,000, effective Aug 1, 1995, AMR said. Crandall earned $662,500 in salary the previous year, and was awarded his first stock options since 1991.

Full text: A banner year financially for American Airlines' parent AMR Corp. led to the first salary raise in six years for Chairman and Chief Executive Robert Crandall, according to the firm's proxy statement.
Mr. Crandall's base pay was boosted to $750,000 a year from $600,000, effective Aug. 1, 1995, AMR said. Last year, he earned $662,500 in salary, and was awarded his first stock options since 1991.
Mr. Crandall's compensation package included performance rewards of $300,000 in cash and 22,500 shares of common stock valued at more than $1.6 million at the end of the year, plus 10-year options to purchase 50,000 shares at $74.687, the price on the day the options were granted. In addition, AMR's board has yet to decide on Mr. Crandall's 1995 bonus, which could equal his salary. The proxy said the firm's compensation committee expects to "approve the payment of a bonus."
Last year, AMR earned $167 million after $334 million in special charges for early retirement programs and a writedown in the value of the American's remaining DC-10 fleet, plus a $26 million loss resulting from the Boeing 757 crash near Cali, Colombia. Without the charges, earnings for 1995 would have more than doubled the $228 million AMR earned in 1994, which was the first year it had earned an annual profit since 1989. Revenue grew 4.8% to $16.91 billion from $16.14 billion in 1994.
Due to heavy losses, widespread restructuring and labor disputes, Mr. Crandall, who is 60 years old, had forgone raises in his base pay since 1989, and was last granted stock options in 1991.
In 1994, Mr. Crandall was paid $600,000 in base salary, a bonus of $395,000, plus $300,000 in cash and 22,500 "performance shares" for hitting objectives.

Branson starts aerial war by embarrassing Crandall

http://search.proquest.com/docview/398493621?accountid=14553

Abstract: Richard Branson, founder of Virgin Atlantic Airways, has launched an all-out attack on American Airlines' Robert Crandall by resurrecting a newspaper ad nearly 15-years-old in which Crandall tried to get a rival to conspire to raise fares. Branson's move is an attempt to defuse American Airlines' proposed alliance with British Airways PLC.

Full text: The battle over American Airlines' proposed alliance with British Airways took an ugly turn yesterday, when the phone call that may forever haunt Robert Crandall, American's chairman and chief executive, surfaced publicly once again.
This time, the nearly 15-year-old conversation -- in which Mr. Crandall tried to get a rival to conspire to raise fares -- was resurrected in newspaper ads purchased by Richard Branson, founder of Virgin Atlantic Airways. Feeling threatened by the proposed powerhouse alliance, he launched an all-out attack on Mr. Crandall. The war is likely to get even nastier before governments on both sides of the Atlantic pass judgment on the joint venture.
Aiming to derail the American-British Air joint venture, Mr. Branson took out a series of full-page ads that reprinted the transcript of the notorious conversation. Mr. Crandall's words were taken from a U.S. Justice Department transcript of the 1982 conversation.
"Raise your g fares 20%. I'll raise mine the next morning," Mr. Crandall said to Howard Putnam, president of now-defunct Braniff International. "You'll make more money and I will too."
The phone call was secretly tape-recorded by Mr. Putnam's attorney and turned over to the Justice Department, which subsequently filed a price-fixing conspiracy charge against Mr. Crandall.
To settle the matter, Mr. Crandall later signed a consent decree that required him to keep a written record of discussions with other airline executives. The public punishment has been far more severe, however. Through the years, competitors, union foes and others caught in Mr. Crandall's crosshairs have repeatedly revived the Putnam call.
As for the newspaper ad, American issued a statement yesterday saying, "While we understand his panic, we are disappointed that he has chosen to dredge up issues that were resolved 15 years ago, and have nothing to do with competition at Heathrow."
Executives inside the AMR Corp. unit said that Mr. Crandall was deeply hurt by the ad, but kept his temper. "He wasn't really happy when he heard about it this morning," said one American official, "but it wasn't anything really frantic, in relative terms."
Mr. Crandall told associates that he was resigned to the indisputable fact that the call will never be forgotten. "He's terribly sad about this dirty trick by Branson," one executive says.
"How do I ever get out from under this?" Mr. Crandall wondered aloud yesterday, according to one American executive.
Although Mr. Crandall personally declined comment, American retorted that Mr. Branson has longed for more access to the U.S. market, which they claim is precisely what the deal could bring him. Privately, some American executives urged an airing of Mr. Branson's own dirty laundry, such as a pending sexual harassment lawsuit, recently filed by a former Virgin public-relations manager in a federal court in New York. Mr. Branson has denied the woman's allegations.
In aviation circles, few outside American have much sympathy for Mr. Crandall, whose fierce competitiveness has sparked rivals' lawsuits and employees' strikes. "Nobody says, `Too bad for Bob,'" says Gordon Bethune, chief executive of Continental Airlines.
But Mr. Putnam, who tape-recorded Mr. Crandall and blamed him for much of Braniff's failure, said he felt a bit sorry for his former nemesis. "I always considered Bob a friend before that phone call," he said, although the two have never spoken since.
Such battles are nothing new for Mr. Crandall or Mr. Branson. The flamboyant Mr. Branson alleged in 1992 that British Airways had engaged in a "dirty tricks" campaign aimed at poaching Virgin passengers at London's Heathrow Airport. When British Airways tried to dismiss the charges as publicity-seeking on Mr. Branson's part, Mr. Branson sued for libel. The claim was settled by British Airways in 1993.
In late 1993, Virgin filed a still-pending antitrust action against British Airways in federal court in New York. The complaint -- seeking damages of $975 million -- alleged that British Airways was attempting to monopolize the trans-Atlantic market, and again raised the issue of alleged "dirty tricks."
The Virgin boss was critical of the British Airways-American deal even before it was officially unveiled earlier this month. The proposed alliance, he claimed, would create a "monster." Between them, British Airways and American now hold 70% of the market between London and New York, and 60% of the U.K.-U.S. market.
The carriers counter that their total share of the Europe-North America market is just 27%, and that their deal is essentially no different from other international alliances, such as United's with Lufthansa. American and British Air have said the only way their deal will go through is if the United Kingdom agrees to an "open skies" treaty with the U.S., permitting unrestricted flying between the two nations.
Meanwhile, Mr. Branson flew to Washington yesterday to personally engage his battle to prevent the alliance between American and British Air. Aviation officials say he has been offering large retainers to high-profile lobbyists there. "He really is making it total warfare," one industry official says.
