Research Project
- Parsed through newspaper articles looking for keywords, such as company and CEO names
- Splits each newspaper into multiple articles and then puts them into two categories: Relevant and Irrelevant
- Based on the number of times a CEO name appears
- Nicely puts the newly created files into their own directories
